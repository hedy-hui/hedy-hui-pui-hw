# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio website that effectively showcases my design projects and coding skills. The portfolio will serve as a dynamic representation of my work, aimed at attracting potential employers and demonstrating my proficiency in UX/UI design and web development. It will feature a home page, three projects that I have worked on, a photography page, an about page, and a resume page.

## High-Fi Prototypes

### *Prototype 1*

![prototype 1](./images_FP2/Prototype%201.png)

On the Landing Page, users appreciated the readable structure and engaging project images but suggested clearer project titles and making images clickable. The Project Page was praised for its intuitive navigation and the highlighted "How might we" section, but it would benefit from larger margins and consistent heading colors. On the Photography Page, users valued the easy navigation and personal perspective but recommended adding a theme, consistent spacing, and a carousel for improved photo display. The About Page images were well-received; however, participants suggested more descriptive headings and narrower text. Overall, users expressed that the top navigation bar was effective for easy access across pages.

### *Prototype 2*
![prototype 2](./images_FP2/Prototype%202.png)

Prototype 2 differed from Prototype 1 in terms of the navigation bar. Prototype 2 has a left-side navigation bar, and users found that the black color was visually overpowering and created a sense of division across the pages. While the sidebar placement of the logo and navigation tabs was unique, participants noted that the tabs were difficult to read due to their 90-degree rotation, which made navigation less intuitive. This layout was also seen as less cohesive overall, as the bold sidebar color contrasted sharply with the rest of the page content. Users expressed a preference for the design of prototype 1 as it feels more unified and offers easier readability in navigation.

## Usability Test

In Prototype 1, users appreciated the Landing Page for its readable structure, clear focus on my name, and visually engaging project images. However, they suggested clarifying project titles for better understanding and making images clickable to improve navigation. Hence, for the final design, I clarified project titles and made images clickable, allowing users to explore projects more intuitively.

On the Project Page, the navigation bar and the emphasis on the "How might we" statement were positively received. Users recommended increasing the margins to prevent crowding. Therefore, I adjusted the margins from 100px to 200px across all pages, so as to improve readability for users. 

For the Photography Page, users appreciated how I used photos to convey how I view the world, but they suggested enhancing spacing consistency and adopting a thematic organization. To address this, I categorized the photos into themes, such as "sunset", "cherry blossoms", and "harbor", and implemented carousels for better presentation and smoother browsing, enhancing the page's flow and organization.

Meanwhile, feedback on Prototype 2 was more critical, particularly regarding the left-side sidebar. Users felt that the black color was too bold and created a division across the page, drawing their attention away from the content of the page. Additionally, the 90-degree rotation of navigation tabs made them difficult to read. That's why they preferred the design of prototype 1. Hence, I decided to finalize Prototype 1 as my preferred layout for the final design, since it better supports readability, consistency, and user-friendly navigation.

## Updated Designs
![Updated Designs](./images_FP2/Final%20Prototype.png)

Based on user feedback, I decided to use top navigation for my portfolio as it is intuitive and supports smoother navigation. I kept a white background as the main color with blue accents throughout the pages to maintain a consistent, cohesive design. To enhance readability, I increased margins so the text does not spread across the entire screen, making it easier to read. For the Photography page, I organized photos in themed carousels—such as “Sunsets” and “Harbors”—to improve visual flow and add structure, allowing users to browse images more naturally while conveying a clear aesthetic. 

## Feedback Summary

In the lab session, one key suggestion I received was to use a circular shape for my profile picture on the homepage. This change would not only add a modern, polished look, but also draw attention to my image, creating a welcoming, personal touch. More importantly, it helps distinguish my profile picture from other images, like mockups, adding a subtle but effective visual hierarchy.

Another recommendation was to update my project photos to showcase a wider variety, making the portfolio visually dynamic and giving a better sense of the range of work I have done. As per the feedback, I also revised the project descriptions to be more concise. By reducing the word count, I made each description easier to scan, which helps visitors quickly grasp the essence of each project.

Furthermore, my peers also gave feedback on improving readability. For example, they recommended reducing the line height in the project titles and narrowing the text box width. I adopted these suggestions because it helps create a more visually balanced look and makes it more comfortable to read, especially on larger screens.

On the About page, I considered the feedback of replacing cartoons with photos of myself or modifying the layout to make it more engaging. This would provide a more authentic representation and add a personal touch, aligning with the goal of presenting my unique identity. For the Photography page, my peer Liz suggested including a short introductory description. This addition would give viewers context for the images and enhance the narrative aspect of the page, helping to convey the themes and perspectives captured in my photography.

### *Libraries and Other Components*

* Bideo.js: I plan to use it to add video loops of design-related visuals or scenes relevant to my work on the landing page. This will make the landing page more visually appealing, creating a welcoming yet dynamic first impression for visitors.

* Anime.js: It is a flexible animation library that I will use to enhance interactions across the portfolio. For instance, I plan to implement smooth transitions when hovering over project images, allowing them to slightly enlarge or animate with a bounce effect. I will also use it to bring in subtle animations when loading sections, like having text fade in or slide up, which adds a sense of depth and polish without overwhelming the viewer. 

* ReactJS: I will use React components to build each section (e.g. the project gallery, photography page, and about page) for consistency and reusability. For example, the project section will leverage reusable components for displaying projects, so I can easily update the portfolio by adding new projects without modifying the entire codebase. Moreover, I will also use React to manage state, such as handling actions like toggling carousels on the photography page or expanding content areas for a more interactive experience.

## Generative AI Use Plan

### *Tool Use*

* ChatGPT  
  * I will use ChatGPT to proofread the text of my design portfolio website. It can help streamline my writing process by providing suggestions and improving clarity. Moreover, I will use it for debugging since it can clarify error messages, helping me identify the root cause of problems more efficiently. Furthermore, I can have it review code snippets, gaining insights into potential inefficiencies or best practices that enhance code quality. 
  * However, I will not use it for final edits or critical decision-making because it might not fully capture my unique voice and design intentions. I will be the one to make final edits so that I can convey my personality in the portfolio.  
* GitHub Copilot  
  * I will use GitHub Copilot to enhance my coding efficiency while developing my portfolio website. It can assist me in writing code snippets, suggesting improvements, and offering real-time debugging support. This will help me learn best practices and speed up my coding process.
  * However, I will not rely on it for comprehensive programming tasks, as it may not understand the specific context of my project or provide optimal solutions for complex problems.

### *Responsible Use*

In using Generative AI tools, I will ensure responsible use by properly citing any contributions made by these tools in my work. I recognize the importance of evaluating the outputs generated by AI before adopting them into my projects, as this will help maintain the integrity and quality of my content. Additionally, I will take full responsibility for making final decisions on both content and design, ensuring that my unique voice and vision are accurately represented in my design portfolio.

## Feedback Summary

For the Portfolio website project, feedback emphasized improving the information architecture for the home, case study, and about pages. My classmates and TA suggested reusing styles, creating templates, and organizing files into folders to enhance code organization and maintainability. For instance, a well-structured codebase would facilitate easier updates and scalability in the future. They also advised that if I use a pre-existing template, I should personalize it to showcase my unique skills and aesthetic preferences, ensuring the site reflects my learning and stands out from generic designs commonly seen online. For interactivity, hover effects were recommended instead of pre-loading elements, which would enhance user engagement by providing a more dynamic browsing experience.

In the Budget Tracker project, critiques highlighted the importance of user privacy and the incorporation of advanced features. My classmates recommended implementing AI-driven categorization to simplify user input, thereby creating a more intuitive and streamlined experience for users managing their finances. Privacy concerns were raised regarding the sensitive nature of the financial data users would input.

The Emotion Diary project received feedback focused on enhancing user interaction and data visualization. Suggestions included using customizable pie charts and other graphic representations to provide clearer insights into emotional trends over time. Additionally, they encouraged me to collect more diverse data to support varied visual displays and facilitate deeper analysis of users' emotional patterns.

Furthermore, allowing users to create accounts was advised to ensure data security and retention.

Overall, the feedback encouraged me to prioritize core functionality while considering nice-to-have features if time permits, allowing for a balance between essential and enhanced user experiences.


## Feedback Digestion

Based on the feedback received during the critique session, I will prioritize the following suggestions:

For the Portfolio website, I plan to implement the recommendation to create templates, as this will streamline development and facilitate future updates. Personalizing a pre-existing template is also a priority, as it will showcase my unique skills and design philosophy, setting my portfolio apart from others. Additionally, I will incorporate hover effects to foster a more interactive experience, ensuring that visitors engage actively with my portfolio rather than passively reading through it.

In the Budget Tracker project, addressing privacy concerns is paramount, given the sensitivity of financial data. While the suggestion to use AI-driven categorization is appealing, as it could simplify user input and enhance usability, I may ultimately dismiss it due to potential complications in ensuring data privacy and security. I want to prioritize building a solid foundation focused on user trust before incorporating more complex features.

For the Emotion Diary, the feedback on data visualization and user interaction resonated strongly with me. I plan to integrate customizable pie charts and varied visual displays to provide deeper insights into emotional patterns, enhancing user engagement. Moreover, I will implement features that allow optional note-taking and the ability to mark significant entries, as these will encourage users to reflect more meaningfully on their emotions.

Overall, I am more inclined toward the Emotion Diary project because it aligns closely with my personal interests. My classmates also highlighted its significant potential for development due to its unique concept. Unlike the Budget Tracker, which may present privacy concerns, the Emotion Diary offers a creative avenue to explore emotional well-being without the same level of sensitivity associated with financial data, making it an exciting project to develop further.
