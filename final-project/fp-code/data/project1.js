    overview: "CPII ChatDoc Master is a no-code B2B AI tool that generates conversational chatbots by parsing uploaded websites and PDFs. It enables businesses to build customized chatbots for seamless integration into their websites. As CPII ChatDoc Master was initially a rudimentary research tool with a simple design, I redesigned and enhanced it with new features, turning it into a market-ready solution for business adoption.",
    problems: "When I took over the project, CPII ChatDoc Master was being transformed from a basic research tool for our company's internal use to a B2B product. There were two problems.",
    research: "There were many potential features for the redesign. But should they all be added? After discussing with the development team, I considered the technical and resource limitations, and prioritized features that directly address user needs and were feasible to develop.",
    opportunity: "How might we redesign CPII ChatDoc Master to create a more intuitive and customizable chatbot-building experience?",
    takeaways: "This project has been an invaluable learning experience for me. Working as a UX designer in real-world settings highlighted the significance of understanding technical constraints. While my goal is to create designs that meet user needs, a design is ineffective if it cannot be implemented. Therefore, maintaining early and ongoing communication with developers to discuss design feasibility is crucial. Additionally, I witnessed the importance of design iteration firsthand. I frequently modified my designs based on discussions with developers and feedback from usability testing and user interviews. This iterative process greatly enhanced the overall quality of the final product."
